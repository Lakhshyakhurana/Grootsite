        Maybe two<br>

        Every second<br>

        What else is there to be explored and go through<br>
        If you had a choice will there be something <br>
        You would like to undo <br>
        <br>
        You think back and blink your eyes <br>
        You look for things you did wrong and those you did right <br>
        What exactly could you name a mistake?<br>
        What are the things that were at stake?<br>
        You sat on the swing in the night and began to contemplate
        <br>
        <br>
        Life is all about ups and downs <br>
        Like the swing on which you are trying to frown  <br>
        The more you push the higher you go <br>
        The zeal to achieve something great <br>
        Taking something that's beyond your fate <br>
        <br>
        You smile at the moon <br>
        If only you had known <br>
        You could've done something better <br>
        To change your future forever
        <br><br>

        Thinking without blinking <br>
        Sitting on a swing of hope <br>
        Why don't I think about the good things? <br>
        Why life is all about bling? <br>
        The nights get dark <br>
        The winds get cold <br>
        You remember the day <br>
        The hands that you hold <br>
        The people that were close <br>
        The gems that you lost <br>
        <br>
        But now you're all alone <br>
        What is that sound?<br>
        Is it the sound of nature<br>
        The sky the earth and every living thing <br>
        Are singing a song
        <br>
        <br>
        What is this? <br>
        Are you crying? <br>
        Was coming here a mistake<br>
        It was a risk you had to take <br>
        You smile and this time<br>
        It's not fake!<br>
        <br>
        Pushing the swing <br>
        You go up in the sky <br>
        You see the light <br>
        Everyone you had<br>
        Everything you lost <br>
        Was in sight <br>
        Nothing was even worth the fight<br>
        <br>
        Only if you had enjoyed <br>
        The moments of joy <br>
        Instead of sorrow and pain <br>
        From things you didn't gain <br>
        But you could never refrain <br>
        That was the beginning of your bane <br>
        <br>
        Why no one <br>
        Values what they have<br>
        And leave what they can't <br>
        Dreams are okay to keep <br>
        But only if they let you sleep <br>
        Don't be tensed <br>
        Give yourself some air to breathe<br>
        You don't have to stay on your feet <br>
        <br>
        You won't be where you are <br>
        If you did everything right<br>
        You may laugh at it now <br>
        But you know I am right<br>
        This is not the end <br>
        It's a new journey <br>
        Of finding who you are <br>
        And what you want to be`

        A big smile daunts my face <br>
        In the back, I get haunted in a gloomy chase <br>
        I run away from the thoughts that follow <br>
        Why do I feel so hollow?<br>
        <br>
        My eyes are getting wetter <br>

        I won't feel bad <br>
        For whatever I get <br>
        Or whatever I had!<br>
        <br>
        I am optimistic<br>
        But it takes courage to act stoic<br>
        I wanted to write my heart out <br>
        I feel like I am floating on a cloud <br>
        Writing is a pleasure<br>
        Took away all the pressure <br>
        At last, I hope <br>
        This was an unnecessary trope<br>
        I will pass the test of time <br>
        I am starting to hear a beautiful chime <br>
        It's bright and so full of light<br>
        I'd love to hear it for the rest of my life`

    It was there the whole time <br>
    We were just blind to see it <br>
    For what it was and what it meant<br>

    They paid the price<br>
    Of our success<br>
    They laid the foundation<br>
    Of our achievements <br>

    The first step I took<br>

    They made me who I am<br>

    Still, I lied <br>
    When I cried <br>

    They felt it too <br>
    Putting our differences aside <br>
    They made me smile <br>
    I cried yet I smiled <br>
    I got up and hugged them tight<br>
    <br>
    One day I'll make them proud <br>
    But if I know them<br>
    They'll just flout <br>
    How selfless they are<br>

     *Dream*

    What do you call a dream?<br>
    The one you think about in thoughts so deep<br>
    Or the one that doesn't let you sleep <br>
    Or something, that adds to the happiness you keep<br>
    <br>
    But how is a dream different from a goal <br>
    I think they are different but have the same soul<br>
    Like a diamond and a piece of coal <br>
    The only difference is of pressure and heat<br>
    The shining one took a lot of beat<br>
    To get to this unbelievable feat <br>
    <br>
    But is the piece of coal useless<br>
    It is not, just clueless<br>
    Of the potential that it holds<br>
    Of the Future, it can unfold<br>
    <br>
    You can achieve what you want, I assure<br>
    By going through a humongous pressure<br>
    Giving up your life of leisure <br>
    Trying to understand the treasure<br>
    Let the whole world see your Trevor<br>
    <br>
    The coal thinks of what if he could never shine<br>
    The only thing he is good at is how to whine<br>
    Whatever you said was a bowl of lies<br>
    Diamond never forms from coal, he cries<br>
    <br>
    I guide him towards a source of light<br>
    It was a fire burning bright <br>
    Brighter than the diamond could ever be<br>
    It only reflects what it receives<br>
    <br>
    In the fire, he could see some stones so small <br>
    They were tiny pieces of coal <br>
    They called him to join the family<br>
    To make the fire go brighter, it was his Destiny<br>
    <br>
    Was this the happiness he always wanted?<br>
    Was this the dream that had him daunted<br>
    He joined them without thinking twice <br>
    It was his dream that had come to life <br>
    <br>
    He took his own path to happiness<br>
    He was out of this unbelievable mess<br>
    The diamond now shined brighter with his reflections <br>
    He reached the goal he was aiming for <br>
    The path he took was something no one ever explored<br>
    Maybe he could've been a diamond someday <br>
    But was it worth leaving everything he had, astray?<br>
    I asked him if he was happy with his decision <br>
    It is okay to keep dreams and follow them with precision<br>
    Just never let anything ever make you blind <br>
    To differentiate <br>
    On what you actually follow and what you want to be.<br>`

    One two here it goes<br>

    The ripples somewhere made a tornado<br>
    He had done and everything he wanted to do<br>
    The child was lost in the ripples of time <br>
    He had returned because it was his time to shine<Br>
    <B>
    He heard the news, the call just came <br>
    He had to think of a name<br>
    For his daughter who was just born<br>
    His emotions went haywire, like a storm<br>
    He was so happy yet he cried<Br>
    He saw her on the cam with her little smile<br>
    <Br>
    This was not a dream, it was true<br>
    The ripples had no color, but the water was blue<br>
    The Ripples were true to their nature<br>
    The circle of life was no ordinary creature<Br>`
