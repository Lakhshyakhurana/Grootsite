                    “I have Lymphosarcoma of the intestine,” Vinay said it without breaking a sweat<br><br>
                    “Lympho what?”<br><br>
                    “Lymphosarcoma of the intestine Bhai, you remember that old movie, Anand?”<br><br>
                    “The one from the 1970s?, wait, don’t tell me, Vinay, how and why did you not tell me this?” The despair was visible on Vidit’s face, he had finally understood the gravity of the situation<br>
                  </p>

                    “Bhai Bhai listen, I had to first get some things sort….”Vinay tries to explain it to vidit<br><br>
                  "Does Priya know? does anyone else knows?”Vidit cuts him in between<br><br>
                  "Bhai please stop, hear me out, I will tell you everything”<br> <br>
                  "What the hell is left to tell Vinay, how long have you know about this? Why did you wait so long to tell me about this?! I could have done something”<br><br>
                  “Do you think I am an idiot?”<br>

                    “No Vinay, I am the Idiot here!, who thought we were close friends, we shared Everything, you were the first person I told about my relationship, my problems, my kids and whatnot, and you just come out of the blue yo say you're dying and don't even think that it was necessary to inform me”<br><br>
                    “Bhai stop, listen to me first”<br><br>
                    “What is left to listen? how long have you known about this?”<Br><br>
                    “It's been more than a year” Vinay tried to keep vidit calm.<Br><br>
                    “Are you kidding me?!”<br>

                    “Why didn't you tell me about this last year, when we met at Ashok's party?”Vidit was getting angry <br> <br>
                    “I wasn't prepared”<br><br>
                    “Prepared for what?! Prepared to tell your best friend that you were in pain? When did we grow this apart bhai?”<br><br>
                    “Bhai would you please listen to me for once!, Are you crying?”<br><br>
“I am not crying, something got in my eye while I was ... Why the hell do you care? do you even consider me your friend anymore!”

                  </p>

                  Vinay moved towards the kitchen and handed a glass of water to Vidit<br><br>
                  “I don't need anything from you”<br>
                  “Just drink it Bhai, I know you are in pain and you're still very very bad at expressing it”<br>
                  Vidit calms after shouting on Vinay for 10 minutes<br><br>
                  "I only have one question, why you didn't tell me?"<br><br>
                  “To not make you panic like you are right now”<br><br>
“So I am the one to blame, right? You're arrogant as always and this time I mean it for real”<br><br>

                <p>
                  “Ha bhai I am arrogant but that arrogance is the only thing that has kept me alive, I tried to kill myself last year after I heard that I had to die, why not die right now?<br>
                  Instead of living with the thought of my death every day and every night, wearing a fake smile and laughing every day as I get closer to my grave.Watching my daughter tell her dreams to me and telling her that I'll always be there for her” Vinay was serious about everything he said<br><br>
                  “You could've tried telling it to Priya”<br>
                  “Don't you think I tried that?! How would I go saying it to her
                  Hey Priya, I would die before I get to celebrate my daughter's 10th birthday, How would she react?”

                  “She's more mature than you are, she would understand everything you say to her”<br><br>
                  “I know that bhai but would she let me be here, she would want that I should spend more time with her and my daughter”<br><br>
                  “So what is wrong with that?”<br><br>
                  “I am not strong bhai, I am weak, so weak that I have suicidal thoughts now and then, I am nothing like Anand bhai, he faced his death with so much courage and here I am, looking for ways to get things off my head and failing”<br>
                  “Vinay settle down, have some water”
                </p>

                  Vidit picked up the glass of water and passed it to Vinay<br><br>
                  “What the hell is with you and water?, You can't take away my pain by just offering me a glass of water, I am nothing like you”<br><br>
                  “I didn't understand the situation you were in before bhai but I do now, so have some water and calm down”<br><br>
                  Vinay takes the glass from Vidit and smashes it to the floor, the glass breaks<br><br>
                  “What are you doing Vinay!”<br>

                  “I thought you'd understand but here you are calling me arrogant at the first chance you get and now you're questioning Everything I say, telling me to calm down! handing me  a glass of water like I am a kid who will stop crying after you offer him a lollipop”<br><br>
                  “I am sorry for what happened bhai, it was an instinctive reaction and I didn't think to listen to what you had to say but please calm down, I will listen to whatever you have to say, go on,” Vidit said as he moved his hand towards Vinay’s shoulders<Br>
                    <br><br>
                    “Finally, now listen,

                <p>
                  The reason I didn't tell this to Priya yet is that I don't want her to get worried, you know that she has thyroid and if she takes stress it can be deterrent to her health, but this is not the only reason, I had to do one thing that I love more than anything, well not more than my daughter but equivalent to her! The dream we once had bhai, our startup, the one that made us stars in college, the one that made you meet Aparna<Br><br>
                    As for not telling you about this, how would you react to it, I had to first look for something I wish to do with whatever short time I have, If I had just told you that I was going to die in the next 24 months, how would you take it?”

                </p>

                  “How much time do you have now?”<br><br>
                  “Almost a year bhai, could be more, could be less”<br><br>
                  “Did you contact Sudhanshu, he works at AIIMS right, he would have cont...”<br><br>
                  “I have been fighting this for almost a year bhai, I did everything I could, I went to US, Germany, Russia, heck, I even went to China but they have no way of stopping this, I have to die, the best they can do is slow it down by some medicines and make my death a little less painful” Vinay cuts him in between<br>

                  “Don't say it like that, you will fight against it, you've always been a fighter”<br><br>
                “Every fighter has a cutoff age bhai, looks like it's time for me to retire from...”<br><br>
                “Okay stop right there, let us not talk about what has happened so far, tell me what you need me to do, I am there for you, whatever you wish for”<br><br>
                “Well give me some time, I will get back in a minute,” Vinay said and  walked towards his bedroom<br><br>
                Vidit stared at the wall ahead, there was a large  photo frame there,

                  with Vinay, Priya, and their daughter, smiling, vidit could not hold it anymore.<br>
                  He started walking towards the washroom with his wet eyes<br><br>
                  <i>Wham!</i><Br><br>
                    He bumped into Vinay, a small notebook fell from Vinay's hands and vidit picked it up,<br>
                    A note was poking out, vidit pulled it and started reading what was written on it<Br><Br>

                  He wipes his tears and splashes water on his face, it was difficult to see his tears lost in the water splashes, he wiped his face and called Aparna<Br><Br>
